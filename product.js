/*
 * SYRIATECH — the product page.
 * =============================
 * `/p/<id>` is where a shared WhatsApp link lands, and it is the only screen in
 * the shop with a revenue event on it. This file renders it into `#productView`
 * as an ordinary in-flow section, under the site's own header.
 *
 * Load order: i18n.js → catalog.js → core.js → product.js.
 * Everything shared lives on `window.SY` and is never reimplemented here.
 * Every class name is the one `style.css` §10 defines; nothing here invents a
 * component.
 *
 * The measured failures this file exists to remove (study 6, 390×844, Arabic):
 *
 *  1. Nothing that converts was above the fold. The primary action sat at
 *     y=922 on a plain product and y=951 on a PITAKA case, and the colour
 *     chooser was 419px BELOW "add to cart". DOM order here is
 *     gallery → brand → h1 → price row → summary → colour → qty + buy + cart,
 *     so reading order, tab order and the fold are the same argument.
 *  2. Tapping a colour called openProduct() → full re-render → scrollTop
 *     1000 → 0. The shopper scrolled 1,025px, tapped, and was thrown to the
 *     top. selectVariant() swaps gallery, price, availability, SKU, favourite,
 *     title and URL in place. Nothing navigates and nothing scrolls.
 *  3. The page was a position:fixed overlay at z-index 95 over an inert home
 *     page — no header, no logo, no search, no cart, no language switch — and
 *     the floating WhatsApp button at z-index 50 was underneath it, so from
 *     y=1006 to y=3102 there was no reachable CTA at all. The page is in flow
 *     and a 64px buy bar takes over when the inline primary leaves.
 *  4. orderReference() was re-minted on every quantity tap: four numbers for
 *     one order. It is minted once, in render(), and cached on the view.
 *  5. relatedProducts() did not collapse variants (three identically-named
 *     PITAKA cards) and included out-of-stock items.
 *  6. fillGallery() read shot.kind from gallery.json and threw it away, so the
 *     manufacturer's English A+ marketing panels were shown as if they were
 *     product photographs.
 *  7. Twelve of sixteen fallback drawings carried a competitor's wordmark.
 *     Those files are deleted and SY.imageSet(p).full is null for a product
 *     with no photograph; no <img> is emitted and the department glyph plus
 *     the product's OWN brand is drawn instead.

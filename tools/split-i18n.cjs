/*
 * Splits the dictionary by surface, the way the code is already split.
 *
 * Every visible string in the shop lives in one dictionary, which is the rule
 * that keeps three languages honest. But the home page was downloading all of
 * it: the checkout's field labels, the WhatsApp message templates, the
 * fourteen governorates, and 7.5 KB gzipped of category descriptions that only
 * ever appear on a category page. Measured, that put the home page 8.8 KB over
 * a 60 KB JavaScript budget — most of two seconds on a 400 kbit/s Syrian line,
 * spent on words the shopper may never see.
 *
 * So a chunk ships with the file that renders it, exactly as product.js and
 * cart.js do. Each chunk merges into the same window.I18N.dict, so nothing
 * downstream can tell the difference — `SY.t` does not know or care which file
 * a key arrived in, and the language test still loads all of them and checks
 * one key set.
 *
 *   node tools/split-i18n.cjs
 *
 * It is idempotent: it reads the base file AND every chunk it wrote before,
 * so running it twice redistributes the same dictionary rather than eroding it.
